# MikoIsTyping! üç§

Or a github repository for my web programming course at Heriot-Watt...

## How do I even use this?

Fear not! This repository may not be the cleanest possible solution to your CS revision needs but it definitely is at least a somewhat fun collection of revision, random projects and weird experiments.

So you can use this for many things - from mild curiosities to actual work (bleh.) either way, just have fun with it or something.


### Do you have ulterior motives???

Yes actually, while I do quite enjoy typing away random garbage on github like an absolute menace I also DO get graded for this (it's actually 10% of this course) so yes, you've uncovered my master plan which doesn't really affect this repository too much but hey, at least now you know.
